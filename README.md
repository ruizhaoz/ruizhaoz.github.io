## Welcome to my page
Hello, I am Ruizhao Zhu. I am third year Ph.D candidate at Boston University. My research interests include machine learning applied computer vision, more specifically, few-shot learning and meta learning. If you have any question, you can reach me at rzhu@bu.edu.

I was born and raised in Beijing, China. Now, I am living in Boston, MA. I have also lived in Harbin (China), Deajeon (South Korea), Providence (RI, USA) for more than one year respectively. 

### Education
Ph.D, Boston University, Electrical Engineering, 2024(expected)

### Recent project
2021.9 This semester I am working on two projects: 1. interpertable few-shot leanring; 2. efficient imitation learning for autonomous driving.
